        <strong>Subjects of study</strong>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall</br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated research, and just </br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of ideas you submitted we are most intrigued </br>
            by are as follows, in order of priority:
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H
                    <SUB>2</SUB>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C
                    <SUB>14</SUB>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F), when the </br>
                        audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>>3x10<sup>4</sup>.)
                        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            So place can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the </br>
            research to take, rquired staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>
        <strong>Exotic dance moves</strong>
        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,</br>
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            <p>Polynesian chicken dance
                </br>Alittle known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
                </br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
            </p>
            <p>Icelandic brownian dance
                </br>Before the Icelandes developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
                </br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably
                </br>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
                </br>modern styles such as Twerking.
            </p>
            <p>Arctic robot dance
                </br>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explores in the 1960s believed to have
                </br>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stiled movements, being practiced by inhabitants
                </br>on Forthem Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
                </br>because they were really cold.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>For of my research, see my <a href="pagina.html" target="_blank">exotic dance research page.</a> on our website</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely</p>,
        </br>
